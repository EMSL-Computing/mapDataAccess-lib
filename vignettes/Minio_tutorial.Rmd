## Starting a Min.io Docker container

Use the following docker command to start a Min.io server container. This is just for testing purposes, not for production!

```docker run -p 9000:9000 minio/minio server /data```

This will launch a container running Min.io server, with the default username and password set to `minioadmin`. Data uploaded to this container will be stored in the container's `/data` directory and will disappear when the container is stopped. If persistent data storage is desired, map a local drive to the container like this (substituting your directory for `/tmp/minio`):

```docker run -p 9000:9000 -v /tmp/minio:/data minio/minio server /data```

You can see the Min.io UI by opening http://localhost:9000.

## Setting up the `mapDataAccess` Package

The `mapDataAccess` package is on the mapDataAccess branch of the Github repo at https://github.com/lmbramer/MOAP. Install the package using:

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/lmbramer/MOAP", ref="mapDataAccess", 
                        subdir="mapDataAccess", auth_token=[insert_your_github_auth_token])
```

After installing the package you'll need to set up a local Python virtual environment and install the `minio` Python package. You need Python 3 (at least 3.6). Unfortunately, there's a bug in `minio` 7.0.1 affecting tags (but it's already fixed in the Github code). So until 7.0.2 is deployed to the pip servers we'll need to check out the code and install it from source.

In the Terminal execute the following commands. This will create a subdirectory called `venv`, so first change to the appropriate parent directory. The Min.io code will be checked out from Github into the `/tmp` directory and installed from there.

```
python3 -m venv venv
venv/bin/pip install --upgrade pip
VENVDIR=$PWD/venv
echo 'Python virtual environment: '$VENVDIR

cd /tmp/
git clone https://github.com/minio/minio-py
cd minio-py
$VENVDIR/bin/python setup.py install
```

## Using the `mapDataAccess` Package

Now after all that work you can finally use the package! The data connection can be configured either using environment variables or a config file. The config file is a YAML file, see the example_minio_config.yml file in the Github repo or create a file like this:

```
type: minio
endpoint: localhost:9000
access_key: minioadmin
secret_key: minioadmin
bucket: map
secure: False
python_venv: [FILL IN $VENVDIR FROM ABOVE]
verbose: true
```

To use environment variables execute the following in R:

```{r eval=FALSE}
Sys.setenv(
  MAP_DATA_SOURCE="minio",
  MINIO_ENDPOINT="localhost:9000",
  MINIO_ACCESS_KEY="minioadmin",
  MINIO_SECRET_KEY="minioadmin",
  MINIO_BUCKET="map",
  MINIO_SECURE="FALSE",
  MAP_DATA_ACCESS_VERBOSE="TRUE",
  MAP_PYTHON_VENV="[FILL IN $VENVDIR FROM ABOVE]")
```

### Set Up a Data Connection
The first step of using the package is to create a `map_data_connection` object that will be used for all data access operations. If no config file is provided, it will look for the environment variables shown above.

```{r eval=FALSE}
con <- map_data_connection(config_file='INSERT CONFIG FILE HERE')

# to use env vars:
con2 <- map_data_connection()
```

When the connection is created it will look for a bucket (defined in the config or env variable) where all files will be saved. If the bucket does not exist, it will be created.

### Storing Data
The `put_data` method will save the data object provided and return a randomly generated UUID that can be used to retrieve it later. (This works the same regardless of whether the data storage mechanism is Min.io or a local directory.) The command below saves the example dataset `iris`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
id <- put_data(con, iris)
```

Note that this method takes an R object, not a file (e.g. CSV file) as input. The object is stored in binary form in Min.io.

### Retrieving Data
The `get_data` method will retrieve the data object via its the UUID returned by `put_data`. (This works the same regardless of whether the data storage mechanism is Min.io or a local directory.)

```{r eval=FALSE}
iris2 <- get_data(con, id)
```

### Deleting Data from Storage
The `remove_data` method will delete the data object in storage. (This works the same regardless of whether the data storage mechanism is Min.io or a local directory.)

```{r eval=FALSE}
remove_data(con, id)
```

### Future Additions
Potential future features to add:

* Min.io provides a mechanism to save/restore tags related to files in storage. This might be useful to save the tags the MAP front end generates when data is uploaded.
* Min.io has the ability to set policies to delete data after so much time has passed, but that is currently not utilized in the R code.
